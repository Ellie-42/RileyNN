# RileyNN
Riley Neural Netowrk is a psuedo-rigid network built on top of Open Neural Network that is rigid in structure yet has no defined inputs or outputs aside from its native text processor that is required to ensure I/O but also enables an internal feedback loop so that the network can learn from it's own outputs alongside user-defined inputs.
